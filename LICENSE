Please be aware that this MIT license applies **solely** to the code and assets within this front-end repository, specifically the user interface (UI) components and related front-end logic.

This front-end application interacts with an API that is derived from the Freechess project. The Freechess project ([https://github.com/WintrCat/freechess](https://github.com/WintrCat/freechess)) and any modifications made to it in the API ([http://github.com/Razamindset/freechess-fork/](http://github.com/Razamindset/freechess-fork/)) are subject to their own licensing terms, which are **separate** from this MIT license.

**You must carefully review and adhere to the license of the original Freechess project and any specific license applied to the API repository before using the API in any way.** This MIT license for the front end **does not grant you any rights** to use, modify, or distribute the API or the underlying Freechess project beyond the permissions granted by their respective licenses.
