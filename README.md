# Knightly - Your Chess Companion

This front-end application utilizes the Freechess API (forked and modified) for its chess functionalities.

## Attribution

This application is built upon and incorporates elements derived from the following projects:

- **Original Freechess Project:** [https://github.com/WintrCat/freechess](https://github.com/WintrCat/freechess)
- **Forked and Modified API:** [http://github.com/Razamindset/freechess-fork/](http://github.com/Razamindset/freechess-fork/) (Changes and simplifications have been made to this fork to specifically serve the needs of this front-end application.)

Originally, the intention was to contribute directly to the Freechess project. However, the original repository is currently closed for contributions, with the author indicating ongoing development of something new, though not yet in an open-source, contributable form. **Adhering to the spirit and existing licensing of the Freechess project, this Knightly project was built as a separate front-end utilizing a forked and modified API to explore and expand upon its concepts.** We extend our sincere gratitude to the authors and contributors of the original Freechess project for their valuable work and the foundation it provided.
I myself wrote the algorithms but turns out my brain cannot process that.
